### Q: Can I change the app name?
**A**: Yes, edit `strings.xml` and change the `app_name` value.

### Q: How do I add new features?
**A**: Check **PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md** for guidance on adding components.

### Q: What's the difference between Manual and Automatic mode?
**A**: Manual shows overlay for each screenshot; Automatic sets timers automatically.
